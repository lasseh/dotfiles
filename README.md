# Dotfiles

My personal dotfiles for macOS, managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lasseh/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
make mac-install
```

This will install Homebrew, all packages from the Brewfile, stow all configuration files, and apply macOS system defaults.
